                        <p class="article">
                            Montessori is an individualized approach to education for children
                             from toddler through high school. It is a student-centered approach 
                             that encourages creativity and curiosity and leads children to ask 
                             questions, explore, investigate and think for themselves as they 
                             acquire skills. A Montessori environment focusses more on a student’s 
                             learning than on a teacher’s teaching. Specially trained Montessori 
                             teachers guide, coach and facilitate each child’s learning through 
                             continuous observation and assessment.

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                        <p class="article">
                            Montessori schools are expensive to enroll into; spending about 10K a 
                            year per child enrollment, lessons are also hard to access as they are 
                            specifically developed and only available for Montessori schools. 
                            The main purpose of this approach to education is for children to become 
                            independent and adaptable in their always-changing environment, especially 
                            in real-life situations and scenarios which begs the question:

                            Understanding the users key to creating the product –understanding the lessons of which the 
                            product will be based on is as important. How people take in information is also key to the 
                            design system of the lesson.

                            easily follow, take in the information and teach their children the lessons The lessons, in a 
                            form of a pdf, video, infographic or any other form, should be easy for anyone to follow, 
                            understand and share –the design is very crucial to executing the product.
