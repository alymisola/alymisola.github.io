                            Here at Coffee 'N Code, we make projects happen.  
                            We are a student run club aiming to break down the barriers 
                            into the tech industry, acting as the stepping stone for 
                            students wanting to dive into the tech world.

                        <p class="article">
                            Every term, we teach 4-5 projects in parallel on a weekly 
                            basis ranging from software, hardware, design and data science. 
                            Your goal is to pick one of the projects and to work through it 
                            until the end of the term to have a completed project plus new 
                            technical skills under your belt!

                        is where I met my current mentors and made life long friends who are as
                        curious and tech-passionate as I am. From interpersonal skills to learning
                        basic coding languages, we helped each other reach our personal goals and I
