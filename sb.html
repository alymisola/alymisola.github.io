                        discovered some keys changes 
                        that needed to be addressed in the redesign: Navigation, 
                        Content and Aesthetics. The product page was an area that 
                        lacked the most, ultimately there was a consensus that 
                        there needed to be a filter system to improve the usability 
                        of the page and a grid layout for the overall design.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <!-- The filter was placed at the top of the page and made to be 
                        a horizontal drop-down menu, so that the user could make their 
                        selections and then not have the bar continue to intrude on the 
                        screen, giving room for more products to be displayed and the 
                        eye to move around. Next, we decided to incorporate a separate 
                        product page so that the user could see individual product angles, 
                        make specific choices of colours and sizes and lastly include a 
                        message before placing their order.
                        <br>
                        <br> -->
                        <!-- The website lacked content that was essential such as the business 
                        information and their policies. To address this issue, we included 
                        a footer on each page with the phone number, address, email and also 
                        a link to the added shipping and policies page. Although this information 
                        is included in the footer it is also reiterated in places such as the 
                        contact page and the about us sections as well, having the information 
                        readily available to the user at any time.
                        <br>
                        <br> -->
                        Aesthetically we decided to go with a more neutral palette of pastels 
                        and earth tones that was featured in one of group members designs, 
                        along with the style of buttons, and finishings that she had used. 
                        Another common thread in each of our designs was a slideshow on the 
                        homepage featuring a welcome from the company, their slogan and 
                        information about sales and events, therefore we carried that into 
                        our final design and choose the fonts and images collectively.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We came to the consensus that the website needed to be modern and 
                        minimal with a relative colour palette to the nature of the business, 
                        but also one that did not detract from the vibrancy of the products. 
                        We fixed the existing navigation issues through the use of a navigation 
                        bar that carried through each page and in page links to more information. 
                        Finally we addressed the content issues by adding the missing information 
                        and expanding on that which was originally provided, and through the use 
                        of a footer the most pertinent information is always easily accessible to 
                        the customers.

                        we would hopefully create a more secure solution that would not 
                        disclose any health information about the users to the public 
                        even to private app users.
