                                we wanted to be more connected and invovled with our Kitchener-Waterloo community.
                                The co-founders and I developed an Impact Partners Package to share with our community
                                organizations who are interested in working with StarterHacks by sharing any arising 
                                problem of theirs with us, whether that is within their local organization or industry wide,
                                that we can share to the participants of the hackathon to create a solution that they can
                                possibly use to alleviate the organization's pain point. Colors and font were created by
                                the design team of StarterHacks 2019!

                        Due to the success of our 2019 Hackathon, we have gained more recognition
                        and continue to do so which will help with our recruitment and upcoming hackathons.
                        The more we grow, the more we can make StarterHacks grow and maintain the tech-opportunities
                        we show and share with our participants!

                    <p class="article">
                        My confidence and interpersonal skills grew as I worked and continue to
                        Work with StarterHacks; I have met so many people that I can proudly call
                        my friends, family and mentors. This team and community taught me the importance
                        of relationships, keeping an open mind, and actively learning from one another.
                        I doubted myself as a co-lead in the beginning of the term, but my StarterHacks 
                        family only reassured and helped me become the leader I was when organizing the 2019
                        Hackathon, am now and continue to be! My journey with StarterHacks has not yet ended!
                        I want to share my experience and values of StarterHacks with other students through
                        the StarterHacks After School Program as well as show the many tech-opportunities
                        that have not yet been seen by these students!
