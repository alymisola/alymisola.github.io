                    <p class="article">
                        Upon designing this app, we felt inconsistent 
                        with its process and solution thus posed many 
                        questions: The main challenge being: 
                        how would a mobile app that also requires 
                        certain amount of motor skills to navigate 
                        through be of help to individuals who are 
                        physically impaired? We wanted ease and 
                        comfort for users and not add another 
                        routinely task to their daily life. 
                        The IoT aspect is very technical and 
                        expensive to implement, especially since 
                        the IoT concept has not been solidified 
                        â€“ this already pose many problems with 
                        regards to the userâ€™s independence and privacy.

                <h3>next steps</h3>
                    <p class="article">
                        Solidify idea and solution and ensure its proper use 
                        and benefits to the users as well as keep a user-centric design: 
                        we would hopefully create a more secure solution that would not 
                        disclose any health information about the users to the public 
                        even to private app users.
                        Solidify the IoT integration within the app and make use of 
                        the concept to better help individuals with accessibility issues!
