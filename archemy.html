                            ARCHEMY is a 3D augmented reality (AR) tool that will help students 
                            understand chemical interactions by using tactile AR markers to simulate 
                            molecular bonds in a 3D digital environment.

                            We all thought VR was fun to play, but we also thought: how can we use 
                            VR as a form of learning in this innovative economy we live in?
                            We are a team of designers, researchers, professors and learners. 
                            We are advocate for education and students’ ease of learning especially 
                            for programs and courses that is text heavy, has numerous lessons, too 
                            scientific and theory based to even visualize.
                            Majority of us are visual and tactile learners and we hope to pioneer 
                            a new way of learning using Virtual Reality and eventually Augmented Reality, 
                            starting with STEM related programs and courses such as Organic Chemistry.

                                We use VR and Virtual Reality headsets such as: Google Cardboard & Daydream 
                                and Oculus Go & Quest, to teach 
                                concepts, theories and conduct mock experiments in STEM-related courses 
                                to ease the learning of students in one of the many challenging courses 
                                taken in post-secondary. The VR space will mimic a real-life laboratory 
                                (from their university or college) for students to get comfortable in the 
                                space and be familiarize with the experiments and lab assignments they 
                                will be eventually conducting after a lesson.

                            Virtual reality has been used for over 40 years in higher level education 
                            and industrial training. In many cases virtual reality training content 
                            has provided significantly higher test scores with users. REF#.

                                    <p class="article">
                                        I initiated the Post and Pre-user testing questions to 
                                        determine how we will be approaching the user-testing phase.
                                        The Pre-user questions would help determine their year, program,
                                        school, type of courese they are taking (in STEM), their learning 
                                        styles and what VR or AR experience they have.
                                        The Post-testing questions will be useful for when we are ready 
                                        to test the A/B protytpe of our product and for after our users have
                                        tested out product; this would help us determining what VR headset,
                                        with the accompanying remotes, is most ideal.

                                        I interviewed my fellow classmates and friends, who were or is 
                                        currently enrolled in STEM courses or program to understand 
                                        their experience with the course materials, how comfortable 
                                        they were with the lessons beings taught, how engaged or 
                                        interested were they in the course and how it reflected 
                                        in their deliverables. Understanding the learning styles of 
                                        majority of STEM students would help us better design our VR
                                        lessons to the users. Majority of students are visual and kinesthetic
                                        learners meaning images, tangible objects and carrying out physical activities
                                        is more effective than listening to lectures.

                                    <p class="article">
                                        We wanted this product to be user-centric and focused on all learning types. 
                                        Our biggest challenge that we are currently attempting to alleviate is 
                                        creating a meaningful learning experience for students with accessibility issues. 
                                        I researched the AODA and read about their accessibility standards to apply 
                                        to the product. I wanted to first start with the most common accessibility matter
                                        to hopefully improve within our product which is regarding sight. 
                                        As a student, learner and ordinary person, our sense of sight it the most used,
                                        however, there are many cases where individuals have sight impediments that stops 
                                        them from having the full experience of the product. As our learning experience 
                                        being the most important aspect within our product we want to make sure our concepts
                                        and lessons are clear and easy to see and visualize in a VR space.

                                    <p class="article">
                                        Approaching this pain point, I decided to look into ways of how to make the sense of 
                                        sight less of a challenge or pain point and more of a fun additional asset! Trello 
                                        boards were my inspiration. Trello, a list-making application, that contains boards, lists, 
                                        and cards to organize and prioritize your projects in a fun, flexible, and rewarding way.
                                        One of the greatest features of Trello is their colored & patterned tags to help further
                                        organize one's action or task card. We always associate colors with organization but not 
                                        everyone can use colors to their advantage due to color blindess and other forms of sight
                                        impairement that hinders their seeing of colors. Using shapes and patterns are the next most useful 
                                        method in organization; everyone can see and determine shapes and outlines that even without 
                                        colors, the shapes and outlines are still clear in sight.

                                <h3>Ball & Stick Activity</h3>
                                    <p class="article">
                                        In chemistry, the ball-and-stick model is a molecular model of a chemical substance which is to 
                                        display both the three-dimensional position of the atoms and the bonds between them. The atoms are 
                                        typically represented by spheres, connected by rods which represent the bonds. I wanted to incorperate 
                                        this method into this activity to help individuals determine which molecular model is needed to create
                                        a chemical bond outlined in their lesson or assignments. Such atoms are determined by color as seen in 
                                        text-books and in physical models, they also vary in size but that still does not help with differentiating 
                                        each atom. I decided to incorperate Trello's color & pattern method into our atom or molecule legend in the 
                                        VR space; this is so that when users are completing the activity, they can refer to the legend and easily 
                                        determine which chemical atom is needed to create a particular bond.

                                        We created possible solutions for individuals who have impaired sight as it is the most common 
                                        accessibility challenge: many have colorblindness and such subjects often use colors to differentiate 
                                        and label specific parts and materials. This is done by using patterns to also label materials, 
                                        in this case, specific chemical atoms such as Hydrogen, Oxygen etc. Not only are these atoms colored 
                                        appropriately but they also have specific patterns on the atoms to characterize its chemical.

                                        will continue to improve to finally share with everyone. We believe
                                        the Virtual Reality industry can pioneer a new and effective way of learning:
                                        more engaging, interactive, enjoyable and meaningful. We hope our product could
                                        be of help to students and professors beyond our local universities,
                                        in the STEM programs with challenging courses such as Organic Chemistry
                                        and hopefully help individuals beyond STEM programs. We are continuing
                                        the user research, transitioning from phase A (rendering the VR space) to B (creating

                    <p class="article">
                        Upon designing this app, we felt inconsistent 
                        with its process and solution thus posed many 
                        questions: The main challenge being: 
                        how would a mobile app that also requires 
                        certain amount of motor skills to navigate 
                        through be of help to individuals who are 
                        physically impaired? We wanted ease and 
                        comfort for users and not add another 
                        routinely task to their daily life. 
                        The IoT aspect is very technical and 
                        expensive to implement, especially since 
                        the IoT concept has not been solidified 
                        – this already pose many problems with 
                        regards to the user’s independence and privacy.

                <h3>next steps</h3>
                    <p class="article">
                        Solidify idea and solution and ensure its proper use 
                        and benefits to the users as well as keep a user-centric design: 
                        we would hopefully create a more secure solution that would not 
                        disclose any health information about the users to the public 
                        even to private app users.
                        Solidify the IoT integration within the app and make use of 
                        the concept to better help individuals with accessibility issues!
