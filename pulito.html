                            by Environmental and Climate Change Canada. ECCC developed their 
                            Pollution Prevention (P2) Resource Finder; it is described as

                            It includes articles and small “hacks” that eliminate waste and encourages sustainability. 
                            The P2 finder can be accessed on the Government of Canada website, but it can still be 
                            inaccessible due to the update of our technologies and ways of accessing information.

                            we thought that the “youth” is a large and vague market. We decided 
                            to focus on a specific kind of youth where they are in the middle of
                            learning to live an independent life, turning their focus not only their 
                            education but their well-being – university students residing on campus (residents).

                            If we targeted individuals who are always curious and in a time of their lives where 
                            they are figuring things out, we can help them develop good habits especially in the

                                        Pokemon Go uses augmented reality for users to play the game while interacting 
                                        their surroundings. This makes users more active and willing to go outside as 
                                        all as collaborate with other app users to complete a challenge. Pokemon Go's 
                                        interactivity with one's surroundings inspired my team and I to also integrate
                                        that into our solution.

                    <p class="article">
                        The EDC challenge was a very fun experience overall; 
                        I’ve learned that we have many pollution preventions 
                        options to choose from that can help make a difference 
                        no matter how small they are. This design challenge 
                        helped me understand and realize the many resources 
                        we have available to us, it’s only a matter of its 
                        ease of accessibility and legibility. No matter how 
                        much information we’d like to include within our app 
                        or we will be including when integrating P2.

                        Two words: Design Systems! Sometimes being in the thick 
                        of the competition, you get lost in the challenge, designing 
                        whatever “looks good” rather than what works best for the user. 
                        When we began designing the app, I started to go haywire! 
                        From the navigation bar to what kind of button it should 
                        have or whether it should have an off shadow with the images,
                         pointless design thinking because I was really focused on how 
                         it looked rather than its system. I ended up creating screens 
                         that were not needed and did not pertain to our idea, the UIs 
                         became inconsistent! We learned the importance of having a solid 
                         design system to follow so that we do not forget any screens or 
                         make unnecessary ones.

                        As we continuously create and innovate, we also continue to mindlessly 
                        make pollutive choices – we hope to integrate Pulito or something of 
                        a similar application and practice in our everyday lives soon. 
                        We hope to involve more stakeholders for research, testing and design 
                        phases as well as explore more design solutions to guarantee its use and reliability.
                        We hope to expand our market from University or College Residence to families 
                        (at home challenges, family-based) and then to an industry of some sort such 
                        as competition between restaurants etc.
